A `no_std` and `no-alloc` tiny ECS written in Rust, which provides strong compile-time guarantees.

This project is in active development but is ready to be used, just note that its API will break often until v0.1.x releases.

## About

`typed_ecs` is a tiny, zero-cost framework that:

- lets you wire plugins together at **compile time** using tuple-based plugin lists
- enforces plugin / shared-data compatibility via Rust trait bounds (no runtime checking)
- is written for `no_std` and `no_alloc` environments (small, deterministic runtime)

## Key features

- `no_std` compatible, and `no-alloc`: all kinds of platforms supported
- Compile-time plugin composition
- Strong compile-time guarantees for plugin/SharedData compatibility
- Zero runtime-registration or reflection â€” everything resolved at compile time
- Light, optimized runtime loop, with direct plugin calls
- Ergonomic design: no tricky or cryptic code needed to use `typed_ecs`

## Examples

Explore the examples to see `typed_ecs` in action:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/heydocode/typed_ecs.git
cd typed_ecs
cargo run --example hello_world
```
